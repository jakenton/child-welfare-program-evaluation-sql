### Simulated Data | SQL | Program Evaluation

---

## Purpose
This project demonstrates how data analysis can support **chile welfare program evaluation**, **funding accountability**. and **outcome monitoring** in a public-sector context. The work is designed to reflect the types of analyses used by agencies like the New Mexico Children, Youth & Families Department (CYFD) to support **continuous quality improvement (CQI)**, leadership decision-making, and federal reporting requirements.

Using a relational data model and SQL-based analysis, the project connects **program funding data** to **chile permanency outcomes** (reunification, adoption, aging out) across fiscal years and regions. The goal is to illustrate how performance measures can be developed, validated, and communicated to support ethical, transparent, and data-informed decisions that improve outcomes for children and families.
