# Performance Measures Overview

## Purpose of Performance Measures
The performance measures in this project were developed to support **child welfare program evaluation**, **continuous quality improvement (CQI)**, and **data-informed decision-making**. They reflect commonly used public-sector evaluation concepts and are designed to be clear, defensible, and aligned with leadership and federal reporting needs.

All measures are calculated using **simulated data** and are intended solely for demonstration purposes.

## Design Principles
Performance measures were designed to be

- **Actionable:** Provide insight that can inform decisions or program improvements.
- **Transparent:** Clearly defined with documented calculation logic.
- **Comparable:** Allow comparison across programs, regions, and time periods.
- **Ethical:** Avoid misinterpretation or misuse of sensitive data.

## Use in Continuous Quality Improvement (CQI)
These measures are intended to be reviewed regularly as part of a CQI cycle:
1. Measure performance
2. Identify strengths and gaps
3. investigate contributing factors
4. Implement improvements
5. Monitor progress over time

## Interpretation Guidance
Performance measures should be interpreted
- In combination, not isolation
- With awareness of program context
- As indicators, not definitive judgments

Quantitative findings should be supplemented with qualitative insights from program staff and stakeholders.

## Ethical Use and Limitations
- Measures are based on aggregated, simulated data.
- Results should not be used to infer individual performance.
- Real-world evaluation would require additional context and safeguards.

## Summary
These performance measures demonstrate how structured data analysis can support **acountability**, **equity**, and **improvement** in child welfare programs. When used responsibly, they provide a foundation for informed leadership decisions and continuous learning.
